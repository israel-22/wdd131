        <h2>About Me</h2>
       
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Israel Santos, i'm a student at BYU-Idaho studying
          Web Development and Design. I have always been interested in
          technology and how things work behind the scenes, which is what led me
          to pursue a degree in this field. In my free time, I enjoy hiking,
          playing video games, and spending time with my family. I'm excited to
          learn more about web development and design through this course and to
          apply my skills in real-world projects.

          I'm originally from Ecuador, a beautiful country located in South
          America. Ecuador is known for its diverse culture, stunning
          landscapes, and rich history. From the Amazon rainforest to the Andes
          mountains and the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador has something to offer
          for everyone. I'm proud to call Ecuador my home and to share its
          beauty with others.
